        <h3> 2020-Lisbon </h3>
        Lisbon is the capital of Portugal and its largest city, with a population of over 500,000. Located on the southeast
        coast, it is the country’s main port and its political and commercial centre.</p>
        
        <p>Lisbon has experienced significant challenges in the past, particularly in 1755 when an earthquake demolished the entire
        city. More recently, the global economic downturn of 2008 greatly affected Portugal but despite such challenges, Lisbon
        has made strides in cementing the city’s environmental sustainability strategy and in turn enhancing the quality of life
        of its citizens, showing that environmental protection and economic growth can go hand in hand.</p>

        <h3> Urban Mobility</h3>
        
        Lisbon has a cohesive city-wide vision for sustainable mobility and is achieving this through measures to restrict car
        use and prioritise walking, cycling and public transport. In 2017 Lisbon launched a bike-sharing scheme, with electric
        bikes comprising two thirds of the fleet to encourage cycling in the hillier parts of the city. It is also promoting
        alternatively-fuelled vehicles, boasting one of the world’s largest electric vehicle charging point networks with 516
        such points citywide.
        
        <h3>Sustainable Land Use</h3>
        
        Lisbon is committed to protecting and enhancing its natural areas, while also providing quality outdoor recreational
        space for its citizens. This is exemplified in Lisbon’s management of the Monsanto Park, for which the city has received
        the Sustainable Forest Management Certification.
        
        Lisbon is also connecting its green areas with the Vale de Alcântara green corridor. The corridor will link up the
        city’s natural amenities, such as Monsanto Park and the Tagus River, with cycle paths and walkways, giving its citizens
        greater access to green spaces. The city will also create new green space along the corridor, allowing the wildlife to
        flourish and protecting its biodiversity.
        
        <h3> Growth & Eco-Innovation</h3>
        
        Lisbon is working towards a fully integrated city, employing a holistic approach to urban planning that considers all
        aspects of the city, including water, mobility, waste, as well as education and employment. The city involves a wide
        range of stakeholders, such as citizens, businesses, universities and international partners, in its policies and
        programmes for urban innovation.
